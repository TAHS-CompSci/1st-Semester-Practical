# 1st-Semester-Practical
A practical skills assessment for 1st semester CSP students. 

Here is a general list of steps needed to complete the Hi-Lo Game:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess. 
2. Display a prompt , or a line of text, asking the user to guess a number in that range. 
3. Accept the user’s guess as input. 
4. Define a function hiLo() that takes a parameter 'guess'.
5. Compare the user’s guess to the computer’s number to see if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
6. Display the results on the screen. 
7. Prompt the user to guess another number until they guess correctly.
    * Can only be done a maximum number of 10 times. 
    * Output a 'Game Over' display prompt. 
8. Ask the user if they’d like to play again or exit.
